# team-tracker
Search football teams and get information about them . Made with python , flask , js , html .
This is a 2 tier application which is used for me to deploy it to azure via a VM or Azure Functions. So it is basically a learning project , so dont mind the frontend (its very basic and lame) and the backend is written just to get data from the database( sqlite3 is used as a database) and display it to the frontend and this is achieved by using the fetch() function in javascript.
